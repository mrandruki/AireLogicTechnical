# What the program does
This program links with both the Lyrics and Music Brainz APIs to find an artist, take out a sample of their songs and produce some statistics based on the data.

# How to run the program
1. Download a copy of Python 3.8+.
    Python can be downloaded from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Use pip or a similar installer to download and install the libraries: "**requests**", "**matplotlib**".

# How to use the program
1. Type in the name of an artist or band to search for.

2. From the top 5 results type in the number of the choice you wish to continue with.

3. Type in the number of tracks you want within the sample. **Note** A larger sample will take a longer period of time.

4. The general statistics will be printed within the command space.
    Two graphs will appear indicating the length of each track and the amount of lyrics used in each song within the sample.
    
5. Click the cross upon the graph window to close them.

6. You then have the option to run the program again and go back to step 1.
